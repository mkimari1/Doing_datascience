# Craft Beers and Breweries Case study

# Introduction

In this project we did a deep dive into the  Beer contents and Breweries in each state. The Beer.csv file and the Breweries.csv file are our data sources. We hope in this project we will be able to understand more about the beer contents, may be do an analysis on all the breweries in different States, and also may be perform some predictions on the types of beers.


# Conclusion

Overall we had a good experience with this project. We discovered that the states with the highest number of breweries is Colarado. We also discovered that with the alcoholic content and the international bitterness you can predict whether a beer is an IPA or an Ale. We found that the alcoholic content and the international bitterness have a positive relationship.
